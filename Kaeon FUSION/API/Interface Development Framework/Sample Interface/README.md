# The Test Interface

The Test Interface serves as an example of how third party Kaeon FUSION Interfaces can be implemented and used.

It can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Gallery-of-Kaeon/Kaeon-FUSION/raw/master/Kaeon%20FUSION/API/Interface%20Development%20Framework/Sample%20Interface/Interface/Test.jar). Once downloaded, it can be used if placed beside Kaeon Dev.jar.
Its source can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Gallery-of-Kaeon/Kaeon-FUSION/tree/master/Kaeon%20FUSION/API/Interface%20Development%20Framework/Sample%20Interface/Source).

When used,
the Test Interface provides a command called "Test Command",
which returns the string "Test Successful".

For example, if Test.jar is placed next to Kaeon Dev.jar, then:

    Use: Standard, Test; Log Line: Test Command

will log:

    Test Successful

to the console.
