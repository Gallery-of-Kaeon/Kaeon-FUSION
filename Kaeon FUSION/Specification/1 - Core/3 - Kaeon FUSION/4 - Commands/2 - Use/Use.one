			The use command contains the content "Use". The letter case of the content is
			irrelevant. It may have an indefinite number of children. It will execute before its
			siblings.
			
			For each of its children, the use command will integrate any available interface with
			an alias that matches the string form of the value returned by said child. The use
			command will then return its content as a string.
