Meta

	Overview
		
		-
			The meta command contains the content "Meta", and may have an indefinite number of
			children. It does not trickle down and performs no operation, but its children may act
			to specify intended results when cross compiling Kaeon FUSION to another language.
			
			It will only affect sibling commands between itself and either another meta command or
			the end of the file.
