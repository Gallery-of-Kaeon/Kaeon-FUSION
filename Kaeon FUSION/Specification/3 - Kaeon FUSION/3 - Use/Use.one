			The use command contains the content "Use". The letter case of the content is
			irrelevant. It may have an indefinite number of children which either have content that
			matches the name of an interface or return the name of an interface in the form of a
			string. It will execute before its siblings.
			
			The command will integrate the interfaces specified by the children if said interfaces
			are available.
