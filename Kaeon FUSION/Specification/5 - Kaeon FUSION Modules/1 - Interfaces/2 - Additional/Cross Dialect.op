Cross Dialect

	Philosophy
	
		-
			A cross dialect is a ONE dialect that allows code written in the Kaeon FUSION Standard
			interface to be translated to another language.
			
			Given that there are certain details some languages may require that would not be
			included in native Standard interface code, Meta commands may be used to specify the
			necessary information. As such, each cross dialect specifies various uses for Meta
			commands.
