Execute
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The execute command contains the content "Execute", and may have an indefinite number
			of children, each of which return a string.
			
			It interprets each string in the order they were returned as Kaeon FUSION code and
			executes said code within the namespace of the script or function it was called from.
