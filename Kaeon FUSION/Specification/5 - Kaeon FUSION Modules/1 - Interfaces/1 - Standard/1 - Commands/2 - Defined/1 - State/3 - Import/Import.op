Import
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The import command contains the content "Import", and may have an indefinite number of
			children, each of which return a string. It will execute before its sibling elements.
			
			For each string returned by its children, it will open a Kaeon FUSION document at the
			path specified by the returned string and place all function definitions created using
			the define command at the root layer of the opened document into the state.
