Greater or Equal
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The greater or equal command contains the content "Greater or Equal". It has two
			children, both of which return a number.
			
			It will return true if the number returned by the first child is greater than or equal
			to the number returned by the second child, and return false otherwise.
