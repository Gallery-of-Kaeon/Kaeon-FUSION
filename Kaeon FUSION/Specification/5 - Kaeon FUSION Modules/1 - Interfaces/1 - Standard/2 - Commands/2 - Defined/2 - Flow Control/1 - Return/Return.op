Return
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The return command contains the content "Return", and may have one child.
			
			It prevents any subsequent commands in the script or function from which it is called
			from executing, and if it has a child, will return the object returned by the child to
			the script or function that called the script or function to which it belongs.
