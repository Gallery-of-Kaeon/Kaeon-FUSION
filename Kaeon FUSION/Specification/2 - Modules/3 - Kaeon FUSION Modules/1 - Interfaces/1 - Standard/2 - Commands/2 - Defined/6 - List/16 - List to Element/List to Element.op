List to Element

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The list to element command contains the content "List to Element". It must have one
			child that returns a list.
			
			It will interpret the returned list using ONE list form as an element with no content,
			and return a string containing the interpreted element written using the standard ONE
			language.
