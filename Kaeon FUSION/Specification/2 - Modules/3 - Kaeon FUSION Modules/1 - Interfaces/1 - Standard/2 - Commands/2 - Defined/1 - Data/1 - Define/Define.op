Define
	
	Philosophy
	
		-
			The define command contains the content "Define" and may have an indefinite number of
			children. It does not trickle down, and will execute before its siblings.
			
			It will create function definition in the state for each of it's children, where the
			content of the child will be the alias and the children of the child will be the code
			of the function.
