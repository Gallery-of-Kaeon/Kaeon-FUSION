	Principles
	
		Structure
		
			-
				A document written in the CSS dialect shall consist entirely of style elements and
				use elements.
			-
			
			Use Elements
			
				-
					A use element shall have the content "Use" and will have a single child with
					content containing the file path of a ONE+ file which has an element with the
					content "Tags".
					
					All of the children of the tags element will each have a single child with no
					children.
				-
			
			Style Elements
			
				-
					A style element shall have the content "Style". A style element must have at
					least one element with the content "Domain", and exactly one element with the
					content "Data".
					
					A domain element's children will specify one of the domains the style block
					effects. A child with no child will represent a tag type. The child of a child
					with the content "On" will represent an ID. The child of a child with the
					content "For" will represent a class. The order in which said children are
					listed dictate their hierarchy.
					
					If an element representing a tag type has content matching the content of an
					element in a document referenced by a use element, The content of the child of
					the matching element will be the name of the tag after cross compilation.
					Otherwise, the name of the tag will be the content of the element. 
					
					The data element's children will each have one child. The content of each child
					of the data element represent an attribute and the content of each of said
					element's children represent the value assigned to the respective attribute.
