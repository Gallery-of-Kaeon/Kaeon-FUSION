Send

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The send command contains the content "Send". It has three children, the first of which
			returns a string in the form of an IP address or domain name, the second of which
			returns an integer number, and the third of which returns an object.
			
			It will send the string form of the object in a packet to the port specified by the
			returned number on the device with the returned IP address or domain name.
