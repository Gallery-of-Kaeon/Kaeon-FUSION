Read Bytes

	Philosophy

		-
			The read bytes command is a command with the content "Read Bytes". It may have between
			one and three children, the first of which, if present, shall return a string
			containing a file path, and the second and third of which, if present, shall return
			integer numbers greater than or equal to one.

			It shall read the raw bytes from the file specified by the returned path and return
			them as a byte array. If the second number is present, it shall start reading at the
			index specified by said number, and if the third number is present, it shall stop
			reading at the index specified by said number, where indicies start at one.
