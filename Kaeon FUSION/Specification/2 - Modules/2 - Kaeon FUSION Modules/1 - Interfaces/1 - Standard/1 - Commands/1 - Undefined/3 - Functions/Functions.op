Functions
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			A function command is a command with content that matches an alias of a function
			definition stored in the state.
			
			The command will execute the code of the function definition using the objects returned
			by the command's children as arguments. If the function returns a value, the command
			will return said value, and return a null value otherwise.
