			A listen call is a type of packet sent through a call command that is used to receive
			input from an external device or application.
			
			It shall consist of the string "Listen", followed by a string specifying the device or
			application to receive input from.
			
			It will cause the call command to return a list which the input from the specified
			devices and applications will be written to.
