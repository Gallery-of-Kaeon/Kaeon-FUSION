Flip

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The flip command contains the content "Flip". It has one child that returns a boolean.
			
			If the returned boolean is true, the command will reverse the order of all of the
			elements in the scope of the root of the elements that FUSION is acting on, causing the
			program to flow in reverse.
