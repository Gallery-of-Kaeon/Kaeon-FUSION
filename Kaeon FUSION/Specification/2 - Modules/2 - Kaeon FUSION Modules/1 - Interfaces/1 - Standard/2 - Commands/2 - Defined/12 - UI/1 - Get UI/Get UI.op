Get UI

	Philosophy

		-
			The Get UI command is a command with the content "Get UI".

			It returns a list containing a DOM dialect document in ONE list form, corresponding to
			the current state of the DOM. The host environment shall continue to update the
			returned list automatically to reflect any changes to the DOM. Any changes made to the
			list by the Kaeon FUSION script will likewise modify the DOM accordingly.
