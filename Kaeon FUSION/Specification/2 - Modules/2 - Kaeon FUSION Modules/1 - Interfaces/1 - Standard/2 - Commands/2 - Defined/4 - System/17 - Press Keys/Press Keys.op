Press Keys

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The press keys command contains the content "Press Keys". It may have an indefinite
			number of children, each of which return a string representing a keyboard code.
			
			It will trigger a bot to digitally hold down the keys specified by the returned
			keyboard codes.
