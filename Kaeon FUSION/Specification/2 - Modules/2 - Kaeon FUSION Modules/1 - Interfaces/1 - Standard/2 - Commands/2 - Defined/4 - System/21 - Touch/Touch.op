Touch

		-
			The touch command contains the content "Touch".
			
			It returns a list of lists, where each list represents a point of contact on a touch
			screen, with each list's first element being an integer number representing the
			horizontal pixel value of the point of contact, and their second element being an
			integer number representing the vertical pixel value of the point of contact.
