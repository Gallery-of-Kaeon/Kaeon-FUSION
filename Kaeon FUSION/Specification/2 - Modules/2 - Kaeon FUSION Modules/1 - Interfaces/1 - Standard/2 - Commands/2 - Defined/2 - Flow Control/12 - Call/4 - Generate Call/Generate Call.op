			A generate call is a type of packet sent through a call command that is used to
			generate a stored standard interface function namespace that corresponds to an object
			in the host environment.
			
			It shall consist of the string "Generate", followed by a string specifying the type of
			object being generated.
			
			It will cause the call command to return the generate namespace.
