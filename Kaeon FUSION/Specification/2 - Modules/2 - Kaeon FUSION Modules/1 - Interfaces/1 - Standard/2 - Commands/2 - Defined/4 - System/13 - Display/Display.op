Display

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The display command contains the content "Display". It has one child which returns a
			string in the form of an HTML document.
			
			It will open a local GUI environment and render the returned HTML document in said
			environment, and will return a namespace that represents the state of the GUI
			environment.
