Release Keys

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The release keys command contains the content "Release Keys". It may have an indefinite
			number of children, each of which return a string representing a keyboard code.
			
			It will trigger a bot to digitally release the keys specified by the returned keyboard
			codes.
