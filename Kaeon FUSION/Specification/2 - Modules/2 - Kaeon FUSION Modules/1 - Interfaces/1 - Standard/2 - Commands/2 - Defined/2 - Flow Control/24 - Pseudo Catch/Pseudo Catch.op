Pseudo Catch

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The pseudo catch command contains the content "Pseudo Catch".
			
			Unless an exception was thrown by a previous command, it will not trickle down. If it
			does trickle down, commands within its scope will be execute despite the exception that
			triggered it, but said exception will not be caught by the pseudo catch command.
