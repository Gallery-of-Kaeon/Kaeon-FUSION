Return
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The return command contains the content "Return", and may have one child.
			
			It prevents any subsequent commands in the script or function from which it is called
			from executing, and if it has a child, will return the value returned by its child. The
			returned value will also be returned by the function command that called the script.
