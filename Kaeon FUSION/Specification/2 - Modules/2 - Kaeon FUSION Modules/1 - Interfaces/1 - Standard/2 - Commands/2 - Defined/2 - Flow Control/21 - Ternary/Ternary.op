Ternary

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The ternary command contains the content "Ternary". It must have three children, the
			first of which returns a boolean and the second and third of which may return any
			value.
			
			If the boolean value returned by its first child is true, it will return the value
			returned by its second child, and return the value returned by its third child
			otherwise.
