Key Index

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The key index command contains the content "Key Index". It has three children, the
			first of which returns a list where each element is a list, the second of which returns
			an object, and the third of which returns and integer number.
			
			It will return the index of the first list in the returned list that has an object
			equivalent to the returned object at the index specified by the returned number.
