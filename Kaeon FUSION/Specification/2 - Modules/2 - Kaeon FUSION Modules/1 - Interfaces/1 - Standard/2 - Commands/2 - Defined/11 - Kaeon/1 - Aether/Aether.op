Aether

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The aether command contains the content "Aether". It must have two children, the first
			of which returns a string containing the alias of an Aether module and the second of
			which may return any value.
			
			It calls the Aether module referenced by the alias and passes the value returned by the
			second child to said Aether module as an argument. It then returns the value returned
			by the Aether module.
