Aether

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The aether command contains the content "Aether". It must have two children, the first
			of which returns a string containing the alias of an Aether module and the second of
			which returns a list of objects.
			
			It calls the Aether module referenced by the alias and passes the contents of the list
			to the modules as arguments. It then returns the value returned by the Aether module.
