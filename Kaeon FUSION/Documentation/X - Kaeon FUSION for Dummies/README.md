# Kaeon FUSION for Dummies

Hello friend!
Since you're here,
you must be interested in learning about Kaeon FUSION.
And since you're _here_,
you must be relatively new to programming.
Either that or you just have a low tolerance for tech jargon.
Don't worry,
we've got you covered.

## Before you start

We cannot emphasize enough how important the art of computer programming is in the modern world,
and how much you can benefit from having the ability to code.

Computer Science is an even grander concept than computer programming.
It's so much more than how to make a cool video game or run a social media site.
It's a liberal art that allows us to both offset the mental burden of our work onto inanimate objects and to bend said inanimate objects to our will.

Though it is not required,
we reccommend you check out the web series [crash course computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo) if you are new to the field.
We're not sponsored by them,
we just think they're good at what they do.

To follow along with these tutorials,
you'll need to have Kaeon FUSION on your computer.

The Kaeon FUSION utilities we've provided run on Java,
so be sure you have it installed.
If not,
you can install it [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

Once you have Java installed,
download our development app, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called Kaeon Dev [here](https://github.com/Gallery-of-Kaeon/Kaeon-FUSION/raw/master/Kaeon%20FUSION/IDE/Application/Kaeon%20Dev.jar).

## What is a program?

Computer programming means giving a computer a set of instructions to perform.
To write these instructions you need a programming language,
which is sort of a comprimise between something a person can understand and something a machine can understand.
If you are indeed a newcommer to the world of programming,
the good news is the options for your first language are vast.

## Why Kaeon FUSION?

The bad news,
is that the options for your first language are vast.
Software development encompasses a vast array of domains,
like web development,
game programming,
robotics,
etc,
and most programming languages are only good for small handful of them.
Start with python and you'll be able to get a lot done at first but you'll hit a wall if you try to do anything heavyweight like write a game engine.
Start with HTML and you'll feel helpless when you want to write code for the browser it runs on.
This problem results from the fact that most languages have only so many things they allow you to do,
and as a programmer you must work within these constraints.
Most langauges, except for Kaeon FUSION.
