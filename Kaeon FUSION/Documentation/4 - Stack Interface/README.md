# The Stack Interface

The stack interface allows Kaeon FUSION to be cross compiled to other languages.

_Futher documentation on the stack interface is coming soon._

<!--

For any given language,
a dialect of ONE may be created called a build dialect.
For traditional Turing complete programming languages,
a build dialect that is similar to code written using the standard interface called the cross dialect is used.

Build dialects allow metadata to be passed to the cross compiler using meta commands.
