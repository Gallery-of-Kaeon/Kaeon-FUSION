# Cross Compilation Interfaces

While Kaeon FUSION Interfaces come in many forms,
the interfaces described here all work in more or less the same way.

Each interface establishes a new dialect of ONE that serves to work for a specialized development domain.
ONE markup written in the dialect established by the interface may be nested within Kaeon FUSION function definitions.
The interface will provide commands that will take the name of the function containing the specialized ONE and cross compile it into a more specialized language.
