# The Foundations of Kaeon FUSION

Kaeon FUSION uses the syntax of a markup language called ONE+.

ONE+ is an abstraction of a simpler markup language called ONE.
ONE only allows the user to define a tree of string literals.

The functionality of Kaeon FUSION is dervived from the FUSION system,
which allows any ONE or ONE+ document to act as code.
