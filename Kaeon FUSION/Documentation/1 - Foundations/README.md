# The Foundations of Kaeon FUSION

Kaeon FUSION code is encoded in documents written in the ONE format,
a markup format that encodes a document as a tree of string.

The syntax of ONE is extremely minimalistic,
but verbose at the same time,
so ONE+,
which is a syntactic abstraction of ONE,
may be used when writing Kaeon FUSION code by hand.

The functionality of Kaeon FUSION is dervived from the FUSION system,
which allows any ONE or ONE+ document to act as code.
