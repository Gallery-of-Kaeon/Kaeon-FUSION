# The Foundations of Kaeon FUSION

Kaeon FUSION code is encoded in documents written in ONE+,
a markup language that encodes a document as a tree of strings.

ONE+ is a syntactic superset but semantic equivalent of ONE,
and compiles to ONE before being processed into a tree.

The functionality of Kaeon FUSION is derived from the FUSION system,
which establishes a ruleset that allows any ONE+ document to act as code.
