## Overview

FUSION is a system that allows any ONE document,
and by extension any ONE+ document to serve as code.

## Order of Operations

At the start,
FUSION must be given a ONE Element to start at and an integer to serve as a depth value.

### Step 1

Based on the string encoded in the element,
FUSION will perform an operation.

### Step 2

If the element has no children, FUSION will skip to step 3.

If the element does have children, then based on the string encoded in the element,
FUSION will decide whether or not to trickle down to the element's children.

If it decides to do so,
FUSION will shift focus the the element's first child,
increment the depth value by 1,
and jump back to step 1.
Otherwise, FUSION will move to step 3.

### Step 3

Based on the content of the element and any values generated by performing step 3 on the element's children,
FUSION will perform an operation and generate a value.

### Step 4

Based on the content of the element,
FUSION will decide whether to modify the depth value or shift focus to another element.

### Step 5

If the element is followed by a sibling element,
FUSION will shift focus to the next sibling and loop back to step 1.

Otherwise, if the element has a parent and if the depth value is greater than zero,
FUSION will shift focus to the element's parent and decrement the depth value by 1.

If the depth value is less than or equal to zero or if the element does not have a parent,
FUSION will terminate.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs during at any step,
FUSION will skip over the step and procede as if nothing happened.
