# Kaeon FUSION Standard Interface

The Kaeon FUSION Standard Interface establishes the basic functionality for writing Turing complete scripts and for integrating the features of other interfaces.

In doing so,
it provides commands for console IO,
arithmetic,
logic,
list operations,
string operations,
file IO,
flow control,
threading,
metaprogramming,
and object orientation.

As such,
one might consider the functionality it provides to be the flagship functionality of Kaeon FUSION.

The interface is activated using the following command:

    Use: Standard

## 1 - Basics

### Data Types

There is no limit on what data types can be generated by commands or stored by variables in Kaeon FUSION.

### Literals

An element with no children that does not match the name of a command or variable will be interpreted as a string literal.
In addition, any element whose content is encased in double quotes will return its content as a string literal,
minus the double quotes.

For example:

    Hello world

and:

    "Hello world"

will both return the same literal: the string "Hello world".

Certain types of string literals can function as primitives for certain standard interface commands.

#### Numbers

A number string must consist entirely of digits and no more than one period.
If the period is present, it must not be the last character in the string.

#### Booleans

A boolean string may either take the form of "True" or "False".
Case is irrelevant.

#### Null

Running the command "Null" returns a null value.

### Variables

An element with one child that does not match the name of a command will assign the value returned by its child to a variable with the alias being the element's content.

For example:

    x: Hello

will assign the string "Hello" to the variable "x", and:

    x: Goodbye

will overwrite the value stored in "x" with the string "Goodbye".

### Function Definitions

A function definition begins with the "Define" command.
Nested with the "Define" command is a string containing the name of the function.
Nested underneath the name of the function is the content of the function.

For example:

    Define: foo
        
    	Command 1: Command Argument 1
    	Command 2: Command Argument 1, Command Argument 2

### Function Calls

A defined function can be called by placing its name inside an element and nesting any arguments to be passed to the function within the element.

For example:

    Define: foo
        
    	Command 1: Command Argument 1
    	Command 2: Command Argument 1, Command Argument 2
    
    foo: Function Argument

will run "foo" with "Function Argument".

### Stored Function Calls

If a function call is nested within a “New” command,
the “New” command will return the state of the function after it executes. 

For example:

    Define: foo
        
    	Command 1: Command Argument 1
    	Command 2: Command Argument 1, Command Argument 2
    
    x: New: foo: Function Argument

will run "foo" with "Function Argument",
and then store the state of the function in "x".

### State and Scope

Every time the Kaeon FUSION Standard Interface trickles down,
it generates a new scope.
Variables and functions generated by the children of a command are erased after the program bubbles back up to said command.
If the flow of the program jumps,
all scopes not shared by both the jumping and landing commands will be erased.

### Indexes

Indexes for list and string operations in the Kaeon FUSION Standard Interface start at 1.

## 2 - Core Commands

The following commands require special accommodations from the interface.

### The Import Command

The Import command will import the function definitions from a specified Kaeon FUSION file.

For example:

    Import: My Kaeon FUSION.op

will allow access to any functions defined in the root layer of My Kaeon FUSION.op.

### The Global Command

The Global command will make a given variable alias globally accessible.

For example:

    Global: x

or

    Global: x: 5

will prevent x from going out of scope for the duration of the program's execution.

### The Catch Command

The Catch command will allow the program to instantly recover from a thrown exception.
If at any point an exception is thrown,
all subsequent commands will fail to activate until a catch command is reached.
The children of a catch command will be activated if and only if it catches an exception.

For example:

    Faulty Command: Bad Argument
    Normal Command 1
    Catch: Recover Command 1
    Normal Command 2
    Catch: Recover Command 2

Let's say that "Faulty Command" throws an exception due to "Bad Argument".
"Normal Command 1" will then be passed over,
and "Catch" will activate.
As a result,
both "Recover Command 1" and "Normal Command 1" will run.
However, "Recover Command 2" will not run as the exception has already been caught.

### The This Command

The This command will return a pointer to the state of the current script,
similar to how a function call returns a pointer to the function's state.

### The Arguments Command

It is possible to execute a Kaeon FUSION script or a Kaeon FUSION function with arguments.
The Arguments command returns a list containing the arguments that were passed to the script or function.

For example:

    Use: Standard
    
    Define: foo
        
    	#[ The "Log Line" command comes from the standard interface,
    	   and prints the values returned by its children to the console. ]#

    	Log Line: Arguments
    
    foo: 1, 2, 3

will print to the console:

    [1, 2, 3]

### The Return Command

It is possible for a Kaeon FUSION script or a Kaeon FUSION function to be called externally.
The Return command will terminate the currently executing function or script and return the value returned by its first child to the caller.

For example:
    
    Define: foo
    	Return: y
    
    x: foo

will assign the value "y" to the variable "x".

### The Build Command

Kaeon FUSION interfaces can provide the ability to code for various domains by specifying custom ONE dialects that meet the needs of those domains.
Code written in these custom dialects can be nested within function definitions and cross compiled to other languages using the Build command.

The Build command takes one child that specifies the name of the custom ONE dialect.
The children of this element specify functions containing code written in this dialect.
The Build command may also take an indefinite number of other children as additional arguments.

For example:
    
    Define: Code
    	# Code written in custom ONE dialect
    
    Build: Name of Dialect { Code } Argument 1, Argument 2

Will cross compile the ONE markup nested within the Code function to another language.

### The Meta Command

The Meta command can have an indefinite number of children,
does not trickle down,
and performs no operation.
Its children can act as localized arguments when cross compiling a custom ONE dialect using the build command.

For example:
    
    Define: Code
    	
    	Meta { #[ Arguments for custom ONE dialect ]# }
    	# Code written in custom ONE dialect
    	
    	Meta { #[ Different arguments for custom ONE dialect ]# }
    	# Code written in custom ONE dialect
    
    Build: Name of Dialect { Code } Argument 1, Argument 2

the Build command will take the arguments nested within the Meta commands when cross compiling.

## 3 - Console IO Commands

### Log

The Log command will print every value returned by its children to the console in order.

For example:

    Log: a, b, c
    Log: x, y, z

will log:

    abcxyz

to the console.

### Log Line

The Log Line command will print every value returned by its children to the console in order,
plus a new line character.

For example:

    Log Line: a, b, c
    Log Line: x, y, z

will log:

    abc
    xyz
    

to the console.

### Input

The Input command will print every value returned by its children to the console in order,
prompt the user for string input,
and return the given response.

For example:

    x: Input: "Enter a number: "

if the user types in "5" at the prompt,
the value "5" will be assigned to the variable x.

## 4 - Arithmetic Commands

### Add

The Add command takes two string values in the form of numbers.
It returns the sum of the two numbers as a string.

For example:

    Add: 1, 2

will return the value "3".

### Subtract

The Subtract command takes two string values in the form of numbers.
It returns the difference of the two numbers as a string.

For example:

    Subtract: 2, 1

will return the value "1".

### Multiply

The Multiply command takes two string values in the form of numbers.
It returns the product of the two numbers as a string.

For example:

    Multiply: 5, 2

will return the value "10".

### Divide

The Divide command takes two string values in the form of numbers.
It returns the quotient of the two numbers as a string.

For example:

    Divide: 10, 2

will return the value "5".

### Modulus

The Modulus command takes two string values in the form of numbers.
It returns the remainder of the two numbers as a string.

For example:

    Modulus: 10, 3

will return the value "1".

## 5 - Logic Commands

### And

The And command takes two boolean strings and returns "True" if they are both "True",
and returns "False" otherwise.

For example:

    And: True, True

will return "True", and:

    And: True, False

will return "False".

### Or

The Or command takes two boolean strings and returns "True" if either of them are "True",
and returns "False" otherwise.

For example:

    Or: True, False

will return "True", and:

    Or: False, False

will return "False".

### Exclusive Or

The Exclusive Or command takes two boolean strings and returns "True" if only one of them is "True",
and returns "False" otherwise.

For example:

    Exclusive Or: True, False

will return "True", and:

    Exclusive Or: True, True

will return "False".

### Not

The Not command takes one boolean string and returns the opposite of its input.

For example:

    Not: False

will return "True", and:

    Not: True

will return "False".

### Equal

The Equal command takes two strings and returns "True" if they are both the same,
and returns "False" otherwise.

For example:

    Equal: hello, hello

will return "True", and:

    Equal: hello, goodbye

will return "False".

### Greater

The Greater command takes two number strings and returns "True" if the first number is greater than the second,
and returns "False" otherwise.

For example:

    Greater: 2, 1

will return "True", and:

    Greater: 1, 2

will return "False".

### Greater or Equal

The Greater command takes two number strings and returns "True" if the first number is greater than or equal to the second,
and returns "False" otherwise.

For example:

    Greater or Equal: 2, 1

will return "True", and:

    Greater or Equal: 1, 2

will return "False".

### Less

The Less command takes two number strings and returns "True" if the first number is less than the second,
and returns "False" otherwise.

For example:

    Less: 1, 2

will return "True", and:

    Less: 2, 1

will return "False".

### Less or Equal

The Less command takes two number strings and returns "True" if the first number is less than or equal to the second,
and returns "False" otherwise.

For example:

    Less or Equal: 1, 2

will return "True", and:

    Less or Equal: 2, 1

will return "False".

## 6 - List Operation Commands

### List

The List command places all of the values returned by its children into a list and returns it.

For example:

    List: 1, 2, 3

will return the list [1, 2, 3].

### Size

The Size command takes a list and returns the size of it.

For example:

    Size: List: 1, 2, 3

will return "3".

### At

The At command takes a list and an integer and returns the value in the list at the given integer.

For example:

    At: List { 4, 5, 6 } 2

will return "5".

### Append

The Append command takes a list and a value and appends the value to the list.

For example:

    my list: List: 1, 2, 3
    Append: my list, 4

will append "4" to my list, resulting in my list's content being [1, 2, 3, 4].

### Set

The Set command takes a list,
an integer,
and a value.
It sets the value of the list at the index specified by the integer to the given value.
If the index is greater than the length of the list,
null values will be appended to the list until it reaches the required size.

For example:

    my list: List: 1, 2, 3
    Set: my list, 2, 4

will replace "2" with "4" in my list,
resulting in my list's content being [1, 4, 3],
and:

    my list: List: 1, 2, 3
    Set: my list, 5, 4

will place a null value at position 4 and append "4" to my list,
resulting in my list's content being [1, 2, 3, null, 4].

### Insert

The Insert command takes a list,
an integer,
and a value.
It appends the given value to the list at the index specified by the integer.
If the index is greater than the length of the list,
null values will be appended to the list until it reaches the required size.

For example:

    my list: List: 1, 2, 3
    Insert: my list, 2, 4

will insert "4" at index 2 in my list,
resulting in my list's content being [1, 4, 2, 3],
and:

    my list: List: 1, 2, 3
    Insert: my list, 5, 4

will place a null value at position 4 and append "4" to my list,
resulting in my list's content being [1, 2, 3, null, 4].

### Remove

The Remove command takes a list and an integer.
It removes the value in the list at the specified integer and returns the value.

For example:

    my list: List: 1, 2, 3
    x: Remove: my list, 2

will remove "2" from my list,
resulting in my list's content being [1, 3],
and assign "2" to x.

## 7 - String Operation Commands

### Length

The Length command takes a string and returns its length.

For example:

    Length: hello

will return "5".

### Concatenate

The Concatenate command takes multiple strings,
concatenates them,
and returns the concatenated string. 

For example:

    Length: abc, xyz, 123

will return "abcxyz123".

### Character

The Character command takes a string and an integer and returns the character in the string at the index specified by the integer.

For example:

    Character: abc, 2

will return "b".

### Substring

The Character command takes a string and two integers and returns the sequence of characters in the string from the index specified by the first integer to the index specified by the second integer.

For example:

    Character: hello, 3, 5

will return "llo".

## 8 - File IO Commands

### Open

The Open command takes a string and returns the contents of the file located at the path specified by the string.

For example, if you have a file called "My File.txt" and it contains the following content:

    abc
    xyz
    123

then:

    Open: My File.txt

will return "abc\nxyz\n123".

### Save

The Save command takes two string arguments.
It writes the contents of the first during to the file at the path specified by the second string.

For example:

    Save: hello, My File.txt

will create a file called "My File.txt" with the content "hello".

## 9 - Flow Control Commands

### Scope

The Scope command performs no operations.
It merely serves to establish an isolated scope in which its child commands proceed to execute.

For example:

    Scope
    
    	# Code

### Break

The Break command stops the execution of all commands in its scope and causes FUSION to bubble up.
It has the option of take a boolean as an argument.
If the boolean value is "False" the Break command will not take effect.

For example in:
    
    Scope { Break }
    	Log Line: Success

or:

    x: hello
    
    Scope { Break: Equal: x, hello }
    	Log Line: Success

nothing will print to the console.

### Else

An Else command will only allow its child commands to execute if the most recently used Break command used since the most recently used Else command activated.

For example:

    x: hello
    
    Scope { Break: Not: Equal: x, hello }
    	Log Line: Success
    
    Else
    	Log Line: Failure

will log "Success" to the console, and:

    x: hello
    
    Scope { Break: Equal: x, hello }
    	Log Line: Success
    
    Else
    	Log Line: Failure

will log "Failure" to the console.

### Loop

The Loop command jumps to the first child command of its parent command.
It has the option of take a boolean as an argument.
If the boolean value is "False" the Break command will not take effect.

For example:

    i { 0 } Scope
    
    	Log Line: i
    
    	i: Add: i, 1
    	Loop: Less: i, 10

will print:

    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9

to the console.

### Throw

The Throw command will automatically throw an exception.

For example:

    Log Line: abc
    Throw
    Log Line: xyz
    Catch: Log Line: Oops
    Log Line: 123

will print:

    abc
    Oops
    123

to the console.

### Exit

The Exit command will immediately stop the execution of Kaeon FUSION.

## 10 - Threading Commands

### Split

The Split command will create execute its children on a new thread.

For example:

    Split
    
    	i { 0 } Scope

    		Log Line: i

    		i: Add: i, 1
    		Loop: Less: i, 5
    
    i { 5 } Scope

    	Log Line: i

    	i: Add: i, 1
    	Loop: Less: i, 10

will print:

    0
    5
    1
    6
    2
    7
    2
    8
    4
    9

to the console.

### Wait

The wait command will take a number and pause the current thread for that many seconds.

## 11 - Metaprogramming Commands

### Execute

The Execute command takes a string and executes it as Kaeon FUSION code.

For example, if we have a file called "My Code.op" with the content:

    Log Line: Hello

then:

    Execute: Open: My Code.op

will print "Hello" to the console.

### Run

The Run command takes a string and passes it to the command line.

On windows,
you can open up notepad with the following Kaeon FUSION code:

    Run: Notepad

## 12 - Object Orientation

Kaeon FUSION does not support classes,
but object orientation can be achieved by using functions as objects.

The state of the function can be stored within a veriable after the function returns by nesting the function call beneath a "New" command,
and assigning the value returned by the new command to a variable.

The In command will take the stored state of a function and execute all of the commands following it within the stored state.
For this reason,
the In command should always be nested inside another command.
The In command will also return a value if the Return command is used within it.

For example:

    Define: foo
        
    	x: At: Arguments, 1
    	y: 10

    my foo: New: foo: 5

    Scope { In: my foo }
    	z: Add: x, y

    Log Line: In { my foo } Return: z

will print "15" to the console.
