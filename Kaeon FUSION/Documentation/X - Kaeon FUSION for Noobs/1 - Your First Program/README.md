# Your First Program

It is tradition in the world of programming that when one either learns programming for the first time or learns a new language,
they write a program called "Hello World" which displays the text "Hello, world!" on the screen.

## Writing Hello World

Boot up the Kaeon Dev application and type the following into the upper text area:

    Use: Standard
    Log Line: "Hello, world!"

_Note: If this is indeed your first program, consider replacing the text between the quotation marks with something a bit more personal. Writing your first program is a special moment, so make it count!_

Once you've done this, click the "Run" button.
The text between the quotation marks should be displayed in the lower text area.
