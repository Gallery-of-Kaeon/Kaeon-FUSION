	Overview

			Kaeon FUSION uses a state system to store and maintain information at runtime. A new
			is created every time the program trickles down, and the same state is removed every
			time the program bubbles up.
			
			The most recently created state is referred to as the "current state". Collectively,
			all of the states are together referred to as "the state".
