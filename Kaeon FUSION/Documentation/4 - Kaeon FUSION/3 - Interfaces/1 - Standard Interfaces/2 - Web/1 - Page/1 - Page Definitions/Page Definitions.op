Page Definitions
	
	Overview
		
		-
			When Kaeon FUSION code is cross compiled to HTML, the user must take into account how
			the code will take effect once cross compiled.
		-
	
	Commands
		
		-
			All commands nested within the page definition will be cross compiled, as tags,
			attributes, styles, scripts, processes, queries, or literals depending on their
			content.
		-
	
	Literals
		
		-
			If the content of a tag does not fit any of the other categories, or is nested within
			quotation marks, it will be cross compiled as a literal.
		-
	
	Tags
		
		-
			If the content of a command matches the name of a tag, it will be cross compiled to the
			corresponding HTML tag.
			
			For example:
				
				Text: Hello world!
			
			will be cross compiled to:
				
				<p>Hello world!</p>
			
			and:
				
				Text
					Italic: Hello world!
					break
					Bold: Foo Bar Baz
			
			will be cross compiled to:
				
				<p>
					<i>Hello world!</i>
					<br/>
					<b>Foo Bar Baz</b>
				</p>
			
			Any tag not nested inside the head tag will be automatically placed within the body tag
			by the cross compiler.
			
			For example, if the entire document consisted of:
				
				Head: Title: My Webpage
				
				Text
					Italic: Hello world!
					break
					Bold: Foo Bar Baz
			
			it would be cross compiled to:
			
				<!DOCTYPE HTML>
				<html>
					<head>
						<title>My Webpage</title>
					</head>
					<body>
						<p>
							<i>Hello world!</i>
							<br/>
							<b>Foo Bar Baz</b>
						</p>
					</body>
				</html>
			
			When using a heading tag, nest a "Level" element inside it to dictate the size. If no
			level is specified, a size of one will be the default.
			
			For example:
				
				Heading
					Hello
				
				Heading { Level: 2 }
					World
			
			it would be cross compiled to:
			
				<!DOCTYPE HTML>
				<html>
					<body>
						<h1>
							Hello
						</h1>
						<h2>
							World
						</h2>
					</body>
				</html>
		-
	
	Attributes
		
		-
			If the content of a command matches the name of a attribute and is nested within a tag,
			it will be cross compiled to the corresponding HTML attribute and assigned to its
			parent tag.
			
			For example:
				
				Text
					ID: words
					Hello world!
			
			will be cross compiled to:
				
				<p id="words">Hello world!</p>
		-
	
	Resources
		
		-
			If the content of a command is "Style", the children of the command will be cross
			compiled to CSS and nested within a "style" tag.
			
			If the content of a command is "Script", the children of the command will be cross
			compiled to Javascript and nested within a "script" tag.
			
			If the content of a command is "Process", the children of the command will be cross
			compiled to PHP and nested within a php tag.
