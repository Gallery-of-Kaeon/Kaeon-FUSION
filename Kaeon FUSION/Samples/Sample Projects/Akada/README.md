# Akada

Akada is a website written using Kaeon FUSION. It was written as a project for a Hackathon at the University of Maryland, College Park.

The Kaeon FUSION code is in the "pages" folder, and can be cross compiled to HTML by running the "Build Akada" script in the root folder. Running this script outputs HTML code to the "Akada" folder.
