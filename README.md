# Kaeon FUSION

## What it is

Kaeon FUSION is the very first programming language created soley to work in place of any other programming or markup language by efficiently and elegantly amalgamating the functionality of said languages into a single language with a single syntax.

The language itself is entirely modular,
inspired by LISP,
and features the elegant,
modern syntax of ONE+.
It has sucessfully been used for general purspose programming,
scripting,
low level programming,
and web development.
In theory,
it can be extended to work with any domain,
and is particularly useful for metaprogramming.

## Disclaimer

Kaeon FUSION is more than usable in its present form.
However,
we are still working on improving the documentation,
on ironing out bugs in the interpreter,
and on new features.
Therefore,
one should consider the project to be in open beta.
If you have an issue with any of the provided resources,
please let us know.

## FAQs

### How can I try it out?

The current implementation of Kaeon FUSION runs on Java,
so make sure you have Java installed.
If not,
you can install it here:
https://www.java.com/en/download/

To begin, download the file "Kaeon Dev.jar" from https://github.com/Gallery-of-Kaeon/Kaeon-FUSION/tree/master/Kaeon%20FUSION/IDE

Kaeon Dev is an IDE for Kaeon FUSION.
To run the IDE in GUI mode,
simply open it from the file explorer or open it from the command line without any arguments.
To run Kaeon FUSION code in the command line,
execute Kaeon Dev through Java and give the name of the file containing the code as a second argument.
Any other arguments will be passed to the script.

We suggest getting started with the "Hello world" example below:

    Use: Standard
    
    Log Line: "Hello, world!"

### The documentation describes four different things: ONE, ONE+, FUSION, and Kaeon FUSION. What's that about?

Unlike most other languages,
Kaeon FUSION actually borrows its syntax from a language called ONE.
ONE is a very simple markup language that allows the user to define a tree of strings.
ONE+ is a superset of ONE that makes it easier to write large amounts of ONE markup by hand.
FUSION is a system that allows a ONE document to be interpreted as code,
and Kaeon FUSION is the de facto standard dialect of FUSION.

### What's the difference between an interface and a library?

In the context of Kaeon FUSION,
a library is a set of functions written in Kaeon FUSION that can be shared across Kaeon FUSION files.
An interface is a set of Kaeon FUSION commands not present in the defualt Kaeon FUSION language, but can be added in at runtime.
They are written in the same language as the interpreter,
and therefore for our implementation they are written in Java.

### How can a language be inspired by LISP without being LISP?

The main differences between FUSION and LISP are that FUSION uses doubly linked trees instead of singly linked lists,
and that FUSION boasts a far nicer syntax.
While FUSION may not be too far a cry from pure LISP,
Kaeon FUSION is very different from popular LISP dialects like Common LISP,
Scheme,
or Clojure.

### You say this language can theoretically do anything?

Kaeon FUSION can expand its functionality at runtime through modular interfaces.
Interfaces can add new commands and provide access to back end systems.
Some interfaces allow you to cross compile ONE markup nested within function definitions into other languages,
allowing for any sort of software development using one syntax and one environment.
At the moment, the available interfaces allow for the generation of C,
HTML,
CSS,
JavaScript,
PHP,
and SQL source code.
Due to the modular nature of the Kaeon FUSION,
there is no limit to what sort functionality can be implemented through interfaces.
What's available now is only the tip of the iceberg.

### I'm already comfortable with a certain set of tools. Why should I learn Kaeon FUSION?

Whatever domain you're already working in,
Kaeon FUSION either does or will in the near future have support for it.
If you suddenly decide to branch out into a new domain or your employer demands you to work in an unfamiliar domain,
Kaeon FUSION would make the switch easier.
All you would have to do is find the right interface or library for it.
You would never have to learn a new syntax or environment.

### Give me a use case

Let's say you're managing a video game studio.
You can write your game engine in Kaeon FUSION by using an interface that generates C.
You can use ONE to create custom file and metadata formats for your engine,
and use Kaeon FUSION with the standard interface as a scripting langauge.
You can automate builds and manage assets using scripts written with the standard interface.
And you can even build a website to market your game using an interface that generates HTML and CSS.
Never once would you have to use more than one syntax or environment,
and the skillsets of your entire team would be transferable.

### The documentation says I can do something but I can't make it work, what gives?

Kaeon FUSION as a language is defined by it's specification.
As such, the documentation may be updated before the implementation is.
If you encounter an inconsistency or any other problem, please let us know.
We'll dispatch a team of highly trained rubber duckys to deal with with it immediately.

### How often will Kaeon FUSION be updated?

At the time of writing,
Kaeon FUSION has officially been in development for about five months,
and was built upon things that were in development for about one year before the project began.
You should expect to see several minor updates per month,
with major updates occuring between once per month and once every three months.

### What should I expect to see in the next major updates?

At the time of writing,
our main focus is on optomizing the perfomance of scripts written using the standard interface and on polishing the web development and machine code interfaces.
We also intend to redevelop our IDE with a far more sophisticated UI.
