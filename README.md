# Kaeon FUSION

## What it is

Kaeon FUSION is an entirely modular programming language inspired by LISP and featuring the elegant,
modern syntax of ONE+.
It has sucessfully been used for general purspose programming,
scripting,
low level programming,
and web development.
In theory,
it can be extended to work with any domain,
and is particularly useful for metaprogramming.

## Contents of this repository

This repository contains documentation, literature, APIs, an IDE, and example code for Kaeon FUSION.

## FAQs

### How can I try it out?

The current implementation of Kaeon FUSION runs on Java,
so make sure you have Java installed.
If not,
you can install it here:
https://www.java.com/en/download/

To begin, download the file "Kaeon Dev.jar" from https://github.com/Gallery-of-Kaeon/Kaeon-FUSION/tree/master/Kaeon%20FUSION/IDE

Kaeon Dev is an IDE for Kaeon FUSION.
To run the IDE in GUI mode,
simply open it from the file explorer or open it from the command line without any arguments.
To run Kaeon FUSION code in the command line,
execute Kaeon Dev through Java and give the name of the file containing the code as a second argument.
Any other arguments will be passed to the script.

### You say this language can theoretically do anything?

Kaeon FUSION can expand its functionality at runtime through modular interfaces.
Interfaces can add new commands and provide access to back end systems.
Some interfaces allow you to cross compile ONE markup nested within function definitions into other languages,
allowing for any sort of software development using one syntax and one environment.
At the moment, the available interfaces allow for the generation of C,
HTML,
CSS,
JavaScript,
PHP,
and SQL source code.
Due to the modular nature of the Kaeon FUSION,
there is no limit to what sort functionality can be implemented through interfaces.
What's available now is only the tip of the iceberg.

### The documentation describes four different things: ONE, ONE+, FUSION, and Kaeon FUSION. What's that about?

Unlike most other languages,
Kaeon FUSION actually borrows its syntax from a language called ONE.
ONE is a very simple markup language that allows the user to define a tree of strings.
ONE+ is a superset of ONE that makes it easier to write large amounts of ONE markup by hand.
FUSION is a system that allows a ONE document to be interpreted as code,
and Kaeon FUSION is the de facto standard dialect of FUSION.

### The documentation says I can do something but I can't make it work, what gives?

Kaeon FUSION as a language is defined by it's specification.
As such, the documentation may be updated before the implementation is.
If you encounter an inconsistency or any other problem, please let us know.
We'll dispatch a team of highly trained rubber duckys to deal with with it immediately.

### I would like to use Kaeon FUSION in a commercial project. Who do I make the check out to?
